This Single Page Application has its front-end built with Angular 5 and Bootstrap 4 to create a fast, clean and responsive UI, with a real-time NoSQL database powered by Firebase.</p>
    <p>Douglas Petla is a developer living and working in Toronto. He spends his time developing front end (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery/Angular) and back end (Java, and some C# and PHP) applications, while trying to cross items off his bucket list of things he wants to experiment with such as React, GraphQL, Node.js, Go, TensorFlow, and others.</p>
